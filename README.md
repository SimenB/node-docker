# finntech/node

A base image for Node.js applications, using Alpine.

This image is hosted privately [at Schibsted's Artifactory](https://artifacts.schibsted.io/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/docker-local/finntech/node).

## Why

These images exist to simplify development of Node applications at FINN. They are based on the official Node images, and additionally:

- Automatically install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm`, depending on which lockfile is present
- Provide ready-to-use `onbuild` versions which handle most of what you'll need for the image to be built (see below)
- Install [`dumb-init`](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) which fixes some issues with signal forwarding
- Inject secrets from the file system into the environment (more below)

## Usage

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project:

```Dockerfile
FROM containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:<version>

# All but package.json is optional, remove unused if you want
COPY package.json yarn.lock* .npmrc* npm-shrinkwrap.json* package-lock.json* ./

# Install dependencies for native builds
# This is in one giant command to keep the image size small
# NOTE: `install-dependencies.sh` only installs production dependencies, make sure you do transpiling/bundling outside of the image
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual build-dependencies make gcc g++ python git && \
    # This script does `yarn install` if a `yarn.lock` file is present, otherwise `npm install`
    install-dependencies.sh && \
    rm /usr/local/bin/yarn && npm uninstall --global npm && \
    apk del build-dependencies

COPY . ./

RUN chown -R node:node .
USER node

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

You can extend from `onbuild` to avoid having such a big `Dockerfile` which has all of this (except for `CMD`) built in.

```Dockerfile
# NOTE: `onbuild` only installs production dependencies, make sure you do transpiling/bundling outside of the image
FROM containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:onbuild-<version>

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Make sure to have a `.dockerignore` file in your project, ignoring (at least) `node_modules/`.

By default, these images `EXPOSE 3000`, so it's recommended to run your service on that port by default.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```
$ docker build -t my-app .
$ docker run -it -p 3030:3000 my-app
```

This binds the port (3000) inside the container to port 3030 on your Docker host machine.

The application is now available at `http://localhost:3030/`!

## Custom behavior

As mentioned under [Why](#why), these images are based on the official Docker images for `node:alpine`, and provide all of the same features. However, some behaviors are overridden:

### `CMD`

The default `CMD` behaves exactly as `npm start`.

In almost all cases, you should provide a `start` script and omit `CMD` from your `Dockerfile`.

### Secrets in the environment

Secrets located in the file system (e.g., mounted by Kubernetes) are available in the environment of the Node process if all of these requirements are met:

- The default `CMD` is used
- The environment variable `FIAAS_ENVIRONMENT` is set (we then assume to be deployed by [fiaas-deploy-daemon](https://github.com/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon/blob/master/docs/operator_guide.md#environment))
- The secrets directory (default `/var/run/secrets/fiaas`, changed by setting the environment variable `SECRETS_DIR`) exists and is nonempty

The names of the secrets (i.e., files in `$SECRETS_DIR`) are then converted from `lower-kebab-case` to `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` and prefixed with `SECRET_`. Finally, the secrets are `export`ed into the environment as `SECRET_<YOUR_SECRET_NAME>=<secret file content>`.

For example, a secret named `some-pgsql-password` will be exported as `SECRET_SOME_PGSQL_PASSWORD`.

You can then fetch the secret(s) directly from the environment like this:

```js
const pgsqlPassword = process.env.SECRET_SOME_PGSQL_PASSWORD;
```

Note that the secrets are not available in the environment of a shell. If you absolutely need to read them from a shell, you can:

1. Get your Node process ID (pid) with `ps`
2. Read the secrets from `/proc/<Node pid>/environ`

## Tags

The goal is that this image should be as static as possible, and the only tags that should happen are Node.js major, minor and patch version.

The `major`, `minor` and `patch` portions of the image tag represents the `major`, `minor`, and `patch` of the node binary contained in the image, similar to the official images.

`latest` tag will refer to latest LTS version of Node.

All of `containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:major`, `containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:major.minor` and `containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:major.minor.patch` are available.

See the list of all images on [Artifactory](https://artifacts.schibsted.io/artifactory/webapp/#/packages/docker/finntech%252Fnode/).

NOTE: It's highly recommended to just specify major version, so that you always get the latest patches.

## Testing

The normal docker image shouldn't be used for tests, use `containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:test-<version>` or `containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:test-onbuild-<version>`.

Dockerfile.test:

```Dockerfile
FROM containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:test-<version>

COPY package.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . ./
```

Default command when run is `npm test`.

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t test-app . && docker run test-app
# or
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t test-app . && docker run test-app npm run custom-test
```

Using `onbuild` is shorter. It will use `yarn` to install if a `yarn.lock` file is present.

Dockerfile.test:

```Dockerfile
FROM containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:test-onbuild-<version>
```

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t test-app . && docker run test-app
# or
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t test-app . && docker run test-app npm run custom-test
```

## Releasing new versions

### When

We try to release new versions of these images as soon as possible after the official ones are released.

### How

One need Docker on local machine. Docker must be able to run as non root and have "experimental" features enabled.

One can check if Docker is running with "experimental" features enabled with `docker version`:

```sh
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:           18.06.1-ce
 API version:       1.38
 Go version:        go1.10.3
 Git commit:        e68fc7a
 Built:             Tue Aug 21 17:25:03 2018
 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
 Experimental:      true

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:          18.06.1-ce
  API version:      1.38 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.3
  Git commit:       e68fc7a
  Built:            Tue Aug 21 17:23:27 2018
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     true
```

`Experimental` should yeld `true` for both Client and Server.

Do also make sure that the node.js version you want to release has an official node.js Docker image published to docker hub.
Ex; if you want to publish node.js version 9900.15.2 there should be a 9900.15.2-alpine tag [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

Log in to Artifactory:

`docker login containers.schibsted.io`

Username is your email address. Password is the __API key__ found on [your Artifactory profile page](https://artifacts.schibsted.io/artifactory/webapp/#/profile).

Run `release.sh` to build and/or release new versions. The version should match the official Node version.

To just build the image locally for Node `6.9.1` without pushing anything:

```sh-session
./release.sh build 6.9.1
```

To build and release that image:

```sh-session
./release.sh push 6.9.1
```

ðŸŽ‰ You're done! ðŸŽ‰

#### Replace an already published version

If something is wrong with a published image and you need to republish the same version, just add a `-1` to the end of the tag.

For example, to replace version `6.9.1`:

```sh-session
./release.sh push 6.9.1-1
```

This will publish the image as `6`, `6.9`, and `6.9.1`, but publish a new `git` tag `6.9.1-1` that does not collide with the already published `6.9.1`.

If you need to replace the image again, simply increment the trailing number:

```sh-session
./release.sh push 6.9.1-2
```

ðŸŽ‰ You're done (again)! ðŸŽ‰

#### NPM repository with authentication

If your NPM repo requires authentication, you can use variables in your `.npmrc`, like this:
```
_auth="${ARTIFACTORY_NPM_SECRET}"
always-auth=true
email="${ARTIFACTORY_USER}"
registry="${ARTIFACTORY_CONTEXT}/api/npm/npm-virtual"
```
Use with e.g.
```
docker build --build-arg ARTIFACTORY_USER=me@example.com ...
```

#### Fail build if npm/yarn lockfile isn't up to date

Normal operation is to run `yarn install` or `npm install`.  If you'd rather fail the build if yarn.lock /
package-lock.json / npm-shrinkwrap.json isn't updated, set the `FAIL_ON_DIRTY_LOCKFILE` variable to something.
Now `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` or `npm ci` will be run instead.

```
docker build --build-arg FAIL_ON_DIRTY_LOCKFILE=yes ...
```

#### Oh no, it failed

There might be multiple issues when releasing. Here are some possible issues:


##### Permission denied

On Linux one can encounter the following issue when running `release.sh`:

```sh
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.38/images/json?filters=%7B%22dangling%22%3A%7B%22true%22%3Atrue%7D%7D: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.38/images/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied


Copying over base Dockerfiles

rm: cannot remove 'build/10/test/Dockerfile': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove 'build/10/test-onbuild/Dockerfile': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove 'build/10/base/Dockerfile': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove 'build/10/base/scripts/run-app.sh': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove 'build/10/base/scripts/install-dependencies.sh': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove 'build/10/onbuild/Dockerfile': Permission denied
```

This is due to the user one are trying to release with, does not have the correct permissions to Docker.
Please [see here](https://techoverflow.net/2017/03/01/solving-docker-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket/) for a resolution.


##### "--squash" is only supported on a Docker daemon with experimental features enabled

On Linux one can encounter the following issue when running `release.sh`:

```sh

Building base

+ cd base/
+ docker build --pull --squash -t containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:10 -t containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:10.13 -t containers.schibsted.io/finntech/node:10.13.0 .
"--squash" is only supported on a Docker daemon with experimental features enabled
```

Please [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44346322/how-to-run-docker-with-experimental-functions-on-ubuntu-16-04) for a resolution.


##### Manifest for XXXXXXXXXX not found

One can encounter the following issue when running `release.sh`:

```sh
Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.656kB
Step 1/16 : FROM node:9900.15.2-alpine
manifest for node:node:9900.15.2-alpine not found
```

The official node.js Docker image of this version are [not yet in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).
There is nothing you can do beside wait for the official image to be published.

##### Misc

If the release fails for some reason (typically because you're not properly logged in to Artifactory), simply delete the git tags, correct any problems, and try again:

1. Delete the git tags: `git tag -d $(git tag)`
2. Pull all existing git tags back down: `git pull`
3. Run the release script again
